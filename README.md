A custom lint plugin to try and improve maintainability in Flutter projects by disallowing certain anti-patterns.
At the moment, the only dart lint rule in this plugin is to avoid declaring ad-hoc strings inside Widget/State classes, or passing a literal to a Widget constructor.

Every String used for presentation (such as in a Text widget) should be defined in a l10n file. See [Flutter Internationalization Tutorial](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/accessibility-and-localization/internationalization).

Every String used for logic (such as in a switch statement) should be defined as an Enum or in any other way that makes sense for the use case while following good OO design. Using strings is a clear sign of [primitive obsession](primitive_obsession_wikipedia_link) and should be avoided.

Created with the Very Good CLI üíô

## Installation üíª

**‚ùó In order to start using Flutter Sane Lints you must have the [Flutter SDK][flutter_install_link] installed on your machine.**

Add `flutter_sane_lints` and `custom_lint` to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  custom_lint:
  flutter_sane_lints:
```

Install it:

```sh
flutter pub get
```

---

## Usage üöÄ

Add the custom_lint package to your `analysis_options.yaml`:

```yaml
analyzer:
  plugins:
    - custom_lint
```

---


## Available rules

At the moment this plugin contains only 2 rules:

1. avoid_string_literals_inside_widget

This rule is equivalent to the Android's [hard-coded string literals](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/hard-coded-string-literals.html) lint.

2. avoid_if_with_enum

This rule is made to be used alongside the existing [exhaustive_cases](https://dart.dev/tools/linter-rules/exhaustive_cases) rule, as part of the default rules.

The existing Dart rule ensures you cover all enum cases in your switch statement, which is great for future-proofing your app. However, it does not raise a warning if you are using an if statement with your enum. This is bad, because using if with enum is the same as using a switch with default:

```dart
if (myValue == MyEnum.firstOption) {
  doSomething();
}
```

is the same as

```dart
switch (myValue) {
  case MyEnum.firstOption:
    doSomething();
  default:
    // this default case violates exhaustive_cases
}
```

Therefore, using if statements with enum values violate Dart's rule of performing exhaustive switch.

## Future work

More rules will be added in the future, but in the meantime, I am open to requests. Please go to the issues page and request for further features.
