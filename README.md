A custom lint plugin to try and improve maintainability in Flutter projects by disallowing certain anti-patterns.
At the moment, the only dart lint rule in this plugin is to avoid declaring ad-hoc strings inside Widget/State classes, or passing a literal to a Widget constructor.

Every String used for presentation (such as in a Text widget) should be defined in a l10n file. See [Flutter Internationalization Tutorial](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/accessibility-and-localization/internationalization).

Every String used for logic (such as in a switch statement) should be defined as an Enum or in any other way that makes sense for the use case while following good OO design. Using strings is a clear sign of [primitive obsession](primitive_obsession_wikipedia_link) and should be avoided.
